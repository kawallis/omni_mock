# (OMNI Challenge) 

To start

```javascript
npm start
```
in the app directory

```javascript
node server.js
```

in the server directory

Technical things I would do different: I would normally upload the json file to mongoDB so that I could sort the dates easier. I thought it was a little bit of an overkill to do that so backed off and tried writing an algorithim to get the dates and prices.

CSS things I would do different: Still have to fix the padding issue on the drop down and I would have the drop down to be scrollable so that it would not get so larger. Lastly get the colors to change on the hover event. 
### Stuff used to make this:

 * Redux, Create React App, Node, Express
